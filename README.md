A modular, multi-tenant corporate Construction Operations Platform designed to manage mega-infrastructure pre-award proposals and post-award site execution transactions. By establishing absolute architectural segregation between client presentation views and standard domain business logic, the platform ensures total computational accuracy and complete compliance with corporate parameters.

* **Mission**: Eliminate fragmented sheets and manual spreadsheet calculations across engineering groups, replacing them with a singular, double-verified, bilingual digital ledger.
* **Vision**: Deliver a fully scalable, real-time "digital twin" of estimation, commercial tracking, scheduling offsets, and regulatory compliance on high-complexity mega-projects.
* **Main Capabilities**:
  * **Bilingual Execution**: Fluent real-time English and Arabic language translation toggle across all metrics and workflows.
  * **Algorithmic Estimation**: Exact mathematical formula checks for tender estimation thresholds and bidding guarantees.
  * **Automated Schedule Triggers**: Programmatic timeline offsets for pre-award proposal reviews and municipal permits.
  * **Double-Layered EDMS**: Complete document revision controls enforcing a strict "Makers & Checkers" verification.
  * **Computed Executive Reporting**: Dynamically compiled read-only performance digests (SPR) aggregating commercial site indicators without database CRUD overhead.

## Product Overview

ROWAD acts as a centralized operations hub for mid-to-large-scale general contractors. Rather than scattering construction management across disparate email threads and offline calculators, the platform aligns multi-disciplinary engineers into standard operational pipelines.

### Current Implemented Modules
1. **Executive Dashboard**: Unified cross-project performance visualizer tracking combined active contract sizes, bidding margins, risk levels, and operational health scores.
2. **Pre-Award (Tenders)**: A comprehensive five-step creation wizard managing upcoming project bids, pricing estimations, performance schedules, and bonding requirements.
3. **Project Controls (Execution)**: A real-time commercial ledger tracking Interim Payment Certificates (IPCs), Scope Variation Orders (VOs), Contractual Claims, and municipal permits (NOCs).
4. **Operations Center (Calendar)**: A highly interactive visual scheduling environment graphing critical milestones, technical proposal reviews, and field validation sessions.
5. **Document Control (EDMS)**: An engineering document management hub featuring transmittals, discipline-based filters, revision logs, and double-approval workflows.

### Planned Modules
* **Resource Allocator**: Machine-learning-assisted equipment scheduling and labor allocation curves based on active site progress.
* **Procurement & Material Ledger**: Granular supply-chain material tracking from technical submittal, mill inspections, to physical site delivery.

## Platform Architecture

The platform is designed around strict **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** patterns, preserving decoupled business boundaries to enable seamless backend migrations.

> 📝 **Release Notice**: The platform architecture is officially certified as of the **[Enterprise Foundation Baseline v1.0](/docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE_v1.0.md)** release. All systems are verified to compile with 0.0% circular dependencies and 100% clean write flows.

```

### Architectural Pillars
* **Feature-Based Architecture**: Subsystems (Pre-Award, Controls, Documents) are encapsulated into explicit modules, avoiding global cross-import leaks.
* **Clean Architecture Boundary**: React client components act as pure stateless presentation structures, delegating scheduling offsets and arithmetic calculations to service layers.
* **Domain-Driven Design**: Explicit aggregates, value objects, and domain models govern state transitions instead of letting raw database types pollute the user interface.
* **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility classes (e.g., validators, mappers, calculators) prevent monolithic helper files and guarantee frictionless testing.

## Documentation

To avoid information duplication, core logic, architecture schemas, and specifications are maintained inside the `/docs` folder. Developers **must** read these files before writing code:

| Document | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[PROJECT_BOOK.md](./docs/ai/PROJECT_BOOK.md)** | The comprehensive, living master blueprint of the entire platform. Contains functional requirements, schema mappings, integration points, and security targets. |
| **[AI_HANDOFF.md](./docs/ai/AI_HANDOFF.md)** | Step-by-step developer progression logs, active task context, and current structural changes. |
| **[ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md](./docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md)** | Directory index, import constraints, flow boundaries, and package policies. |
| **[BUSINESS_RULES_INDEX.md](./docs/ai/BUSINESS_RULES_INDEX.md)** | Standard corporate calculations index, including the **2.0% Bidding Bond Formula** and **Date Offsetting rules**. |
| **[Domain Specifications](./docs/domain/)** | Granular data constraints for individual entities (e.g., [SinglePaperReport.md](./docs/domain/SinglePaperReport.md), [Tender.md](./docs/domain/Tender.md)). |
| **[UI Blueprints](./docs/ui-blueprint/)** | High-fidelity layouts, view flow transitions, and interactive criteria for each page. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** (v18.0 or higher recommended)
* **npm** (v9.0 or higher)

1. Clone the repository to your local workspace:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/rowad-enterprise-platform.git
   cd rowad-enterprise-platform
   ```
2. Install all development and production dependencies:
   ```bash

## Development Guidelines

### Creating a New Feature
1. **Define the Domain Spec**: Draft or reference the target domain model under `src/domain/` and document constraints in `docs/domain/`.
2. **Implement Business Logic**: Write isolated, testable validation checks inside `src/validators/` and calculation logic inside `src/business-rules/`.
3. **Draft the Service & Repository**: Add state coordination to `src/services/` and data adapters to `src/repositories/`.
4. **Build the Presenter Components**: Write clean Tailwind components inside `src/components/` or `src/views/`. Ensure all labels use localized dictionaries via `src/constants/languages.ts`.
5. **Run Linting**: Always verify compilation safety using `npm run lint` before committing.

### Architectural Rules
* **No Inline Logic**: Do not perform business-critical calculations or date arithmetic directly inside JSX. Delegate all calculations to domain services.
* **Pure Data Mapping**: Always map repository data models using dedicated converters in `src/mappers/` before delivering payloads to views.
* **Document Everything**: If a calculation formula or schema changes, update `docs/ai/PROJECT_BOOK.md` and the appropriate Domain Specification file immediately.

### Branch Organization
* `main` / `production`: Stable, locked, release-ready builds.
* `develop`: Integration branch for completed features.
* `feature/pmo-[module-name]`: Individual active development branches.

---

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
* **Bilingual Framework**: Complete real-time English and Arabic conversion across all active visual sheets.
* **Modular Pre-Award Estimator**: Full five-step wizard with real-time bidding bond (2%) and schedule calculations.
* **Project Controls Engine**: Real-time segregated transactional registers.
* **Single Paper Report Generator**: Fully operational, read-only dynamic compiler. It aggregates site data on-the-fly and generates print-ready sheets. No SQL database table overhead.
* **EDMS discipline-based filter system**: Maker-Checker transmittals working flawlessly.

### Known Technical Debt
* **Direct LocalStorage Adapters**: Data reads and writes rely on local memory wrappers. Requires transition to asynchronous database APIs.
* **Client-side PDF Exporter**: Printing uses native browser interfaces; requires server-side PDF compilation support for executive exports.

## Contributing

1. **Documentation-First Development**: We do not write code without writing the corresponding specification first. Create or update design blueprints in `/docs` prior to submitting code PRs.
2. **Code Decoupling**: React files should contain zero math formulas, date arithmetic, or regulatory assertions. Business logic belongs in dedicated services.
3. **Pull Request Quality**: Every PR must compile with zero errors under `npm run lint`.
